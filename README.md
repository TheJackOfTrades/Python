# Python Coding Practice

This GitHub repository stores practice programs found on the [Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-projects-beginner-to-advanced/) website for the Python programming language.  

*Note: Not all of the projects found on the Geeks for Geeks website will be created, all of the programs (along with their task description) are listed below*

## Projects

### Beginner Level

1. Number guessing game
    - Develop a number guessing game where the user selects a range of integers (A to B). The system will randomly select an integer within this range, and the user must guess the number in the least amount of attempts.
2. Word guessing game
    - Develop a word guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.
