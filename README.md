# Python Coding Practice

This GitHub repository stores practice programs found on the [Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-projects-beginner-to-advanced/) website for the Python programming language.  

*Note: Not all of the projects found on the Geeks for Geeks website will be created, all of the programs (along with their task description) are listed below*

## Project List

### Beginner Level

1. Number guessing game
    - Develop a number guessing game where the user selects a range of integers between which the system will randomly select an integer. The system will then calculate the maximum amount of guesses required to guarantee a correct answer and then the user must guess the number in the least amount of attempts.
2. Word guessing game
    - Develop a word guessing game where the user must guess a randomly chosen word from a pre-determined list by suggesting letters. The user will have a limited number of attempts to correctly guess the word.
